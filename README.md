### F.A.Q

Q: _How can we **open GNMF BA2**?_  
A: The [BSA Browser](https://github.com/AlexxEG/BSA_Browser) tool by AlexxEG (see credits) supports opening GNMF BA2.  

Q: _Why only one chunk? Does that matter?_  
A: I have not researched multi-chunk GNMF BA2 but for authenticities sake I will try to include the option in a future release. From experience one chunk will do fine, but it can be assumed with a lot of high resolution textures multi-chunk would help.
